The goal of our network of AIR Labs is to redefine retail through technology. We, therefore, explore and develop new tech solutions, and attract, develop and retain talent. The Labs conduct foundational AI research in close collaboration with academia and provide rapid innovative tech solutions through collaborations with incubators. We currently have locations in Amsterdam and Delft.
