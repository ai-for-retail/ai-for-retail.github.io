### Probabilistic Gradient Boosting Machines (PGBM) 

Probabilistic Gradient Boosting Machines (PGBM) is a probabilistic gradient boosting framework in Python based on PyTorch/Numba. It is aimed at users interested in solving large-scale tabular probabilistic regression problems, such as probabilistic time series forecasting. It provides the following advantages over existing frameworks:

 * Probabilistic regression estimates instead of only point estimates.
 * Auto-differentiation of custom loss functions.
 * Native GPU-acceleration.
 * Distributed training for CPU and GPU, across multiple nodes.
 * Ability to optimize probabilistic estimates after training for a set of common distributions, without retraining the model. 

PGBM is available at [https://github.com/elephaint/pgbm](https://github.com/elephaint/pgbm).
