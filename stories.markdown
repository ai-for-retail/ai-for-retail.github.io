### Bol.com "Unwanted Product Detection Challenge" 2021 

Offering products through an e-commerce platform has many advantages. The rich and diverse product catalog is helping millions of users daily to find and purchase what they need. In addition, having an platform enables the companies to sell multiple different items, to easily update content and make the customers happy by providing high-quality products. However, platforms with a broad range and high number of products have to manage and deal with specific challenges. For example, there are a lot of products which should not be sold on the platforms due to legal reasons or low-quality.  This means that online platforms have to regularly check what is offered to ensure good quality and remove the unwanted products. But finding and removing these unwanted products is like finding a needle in a haystack with millions of straws. And that is where Data Science comes in.

To facilitate research in this area, we ran an [open machine learning challenge](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/287/) where the task is to automatically detect and classify wanted/unwanted products.
